        <h5> About this website</h5>
        <p th:text="'This site is served by a containerized Java Spring boot
                     application. Currently, the application runs on Java ' + ${details.currentJavaVersion} + ' and Spring
                     boot version ' + ${details.currentSpringBootVersion} +  ' With Thymeleaf templates and Bootstrap 5 as
                     frontend. I intend to keep these versions up to date.'">

        <p>
            As of writing, I'm no longer hosting the website on Azure's Kubernetes Service via a Github Actions workflow which
            builds and deploys automatically on push. However, because the application itself is cloud-provider agnostic
            this has changed. I'm now hosting it on my raspberry-pi due to cost concerns :).
            DDoS protection & Https is provided through cloudflare, which acts as a proxy between the DNS and the
            Ingress controller. I'm using oznu/cloudflare-ddns to interface with Cloudflare and update my DNS records dynamically
            ever 5 minutes.
            Ziggo only provides static IP adresses to its business customers, which I'm not willing to pay, then I might as well
            host it on Azure.

            Finally, I've made the versions and time-periods dynamic, they're calculated
            serverside. As for the Spring Boot architecture, I've adhered to a layered architecture with easily
            updatable items (experience, hobbies, certificates, and skills) from configuration. Check out the
            repository for yourself!
