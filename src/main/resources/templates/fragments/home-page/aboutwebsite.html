        <h5> About this website</h5>
        <p th:text="'This site is served by a containerized Java Spring boot
                     application. Currently, the application runs on Java ' + ${details.currentJavaVersion} + ' and Spring
                     boot version ' + ${details.currentSpringBootVersion} +  ' With Thymeleaf templates and Bootstrap 5 as
                     frontend. I intend to keep these versions up to date.'">

            As of writing, I'm no longer hosting the website on Azure's Kubernetes Service via a Github Actions workflow.
            However, the website still builds and deploys automatically on push. Because the application itself is c
            loud-provider agnostic , I've (relatively) quickly switched to hosting it on my Debian server due to cost concerns :).
            DDoS protection & Https is provided through cloudflare, which acts as a proxy between the DNS and the
            webserver.

            I've recently moved from 'oznu/cloudflare-ddns' to Cloudflare Tunnel to expose the website to the web, I find this
            approach to be simpler and more convenient for other uses like ssh-ing into the local network.
            Instead of Azure Container Repository (ACR) I'm now using Github Container Repository (ghcr.io)
            for image storage.

            Finally, I've made the versions and time-periods dynamic, they're calculated
            serverside. As for the Spring Boot architecture, I've adhered to a layered architecture with easily
            updatable items (experience, hobbies, certificates, and skills) from configuration. Check out the
            repository for yourself!
